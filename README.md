Material of video PE #77: Dynamic Response of DC-DC Converters under On-Time Current Control

Available at: https://youtu.be/N0VZrRbO8ZQ

This video presents the on-time current control of dc-dc converters. This control method uses the switch on-time and the inductor valley current as control parameters. The static and dynamic behavior are analyzed. Qspice simulations are used to illustrate the different ideas and verify the theoretical analysis.
